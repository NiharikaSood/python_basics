print("Hello World!!")

# Sum of two numbers using user input.

# By default the input() function takes the values as a string. So, even if it is number still it will consider it as string.
# So, in this scenario we have to do is typecasting in python.
#  What is typecasting?
# Typecasting is basicasically converting one data type to another.




a = input("Enter first number : ")
b = input("Enter second number : ")

# sum = a + b
print( int(a) + int(b))
